{{{PLEDGE}}}

Contributors to projects published under free-of-charge public
licenses, or "free public projects", follow unwritten rules about
licensing and contribution.  They expect others to do so, too.
I make this pledge to make those unwritten rules, and the fact that
I follow them, explicit.

Unless I specifically say otherwise in a contribution, whenever I make
a contribution to a free public project, I license my contribution
under the same license terms on which that project is licensed to
the public at the time.

I am aware of legal rules, like "work made for hire" rules, that
may give employers, clients, and others ownership of intellectual
property in work that I do.  I am also aware that legal agreements
I make may transfer ownership of intellectual property rights in my
work to others.

I pledge not to offer contributions to free public projects that I
know may be subject to others' intellectual property rights without
their written, legally binding permission.  When I offer a contribution
with permission, I pledge to make public, as part of my contribution,
who may own rights, the fact they gave permission, and how they
gave permission.

This pledge applies to all my contributions, so long as I make this
pledge publicly accessible at:

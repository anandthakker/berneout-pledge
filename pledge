The Berneout Pledge

$REVISION

Contributors to projects published under free-of-charge public licenses, or "free public projects", follow unwritten rules about licensing and contribution.  They expect others to do so, too.  I make this pledge to make those unwritten rules, and the fact that I follow them, clear.

Unless I specifically say otherwise, whenever I make a contribution to a free public project, I license my contribution under the same license terms on which that project is then licensed to the public.

I am aware of legal rules, like "work made for hire" rules, that may give employers, clients, and others ownership of intellectual property in work that I do.  I am also aware that legal agreements I make may transfer ownership of intellectual property rights in my work to others.

I pledge not to offer contributions to free public projects that I know may be subject to intellectual property rights of others to any free public project without the legally binding, written permission of those who may own rights.  When I offer a contribution with permission, I pledge to make public, as part of my contribution, who may own rights, the fact they gave permission, and how they gave permission.

This pledge applies to all my contributions for one year, starting at $PLEDGE_TIMESTAMP.

I may revoke this pledge earlier by posting a standard form revocation to $DOMAIN.
